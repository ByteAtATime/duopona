literal: |-
  In the past, I
  ruled the world and oceans.
  Now I'm alone,
  no longer owning the cities.

  In the beginning, when I fot,
  enemies felt fear.
  Many of my people chant:
  "The old king is dead. Be our new king."

  After short dayd,
  I come to a dark room.
  I learn this: my castles
  may look strong, but are weak.

  I hear the distant sound of Jesus
  and the Roman armies.
  "Be like the sword and the shield.
  Give the holy knowledge to another land."

  I cannot say the reason why:
  if all the past were
  a dream
  then I would have ruled the world.

  The strong, bad wind
  moves me into
  a dirty room and sounds of fighting.
  People feel bad because I've messed up.

  People of change
  want to kill the evil me.
  It's just a puppet person on a string,
  so, who wants to be king?

  I hear the distant sound of Jesus
  and the Roman armies.
  "Be like the sword and the shield.
  Give the holy knowledge to another land."

  I cannot say the reason why:
  St. Peter won't want me.
  If it were just a dream
  then I would have ruled the world.

original: |-
  I used to rule the world
  Seas would rise when I gave the word
  Now in the morning, I sleep alone
  Sweep the streets I used to own

  I used to roll the dice
  Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
  Listen as the crowd would sing
  Now the old king is dead, long live the king

  One minute, I held the key
  Next the walls were closed on me
  And I discovered that my castles stand
  Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
  Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
  Be my mirror, my sword and shield
  My missionaries in a foreign field

  For some reason, I can't explain
  Once you'd gone, there was never,
  never an honest word
  And that was when I ruled the world

  It was a wicked and wild wind
  Blew down the doors to let me in
  Shattered windows and the sound of drums
  People couldn't believe what I'd become

  Revolutionaries wait
  For my head on a silver plate
  Just a puppet on a lonely string
  Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
  Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
  Be my mirror, my sword and shield
  My missionaries in a foreign field

  For some reason, I can't explain
  I know Saint Peter won't call my name
  Never an honest word
  But that was when I ruled the world
